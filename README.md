# Tic-Tac-Toe_FrontEnd
This is an ongoing small project I have undertaken while learning JavaScript.
For this project I have included two txt files, tictactoebasic.txt and minimax.txt.
These are the two different modes i have included for the javascript .
 minimax.txt includes the minimax algorithm for basically making the game impossible to win at best the player can tie the game.
 tictactoebasic.txt includes a simple algorithm for the game whichm executes a simple game of tictactoe which can be easily won by the player.
the Tictactoe.js file originally contains the minimax algorithm but can be changed to the basic algorithm by copy pasting the code from tictactoe.txt and vice versa.
 i wanted to include a difficulty mode button for the two different algos but i have yet to figure out how to do that. 
 i will upload the updated code as soon as possible
